# Sentiment Analysis of Disaster Tweets

This project uses machine learning and natural language processing (NLP) to perform sentiment classification on disaster-related tweets. The goal is to classify whether a tweet is about a real disaster or not.

## 📁 Project Structure

- `sentiment_dataset.csv` - Dataset containing tweet text and target labels.
- `sentiment_analysis_clean.ipynb` - Jupyter Notebook containing all the code for preprocessing, training, evaluation, and prediction.

## 📌 Techniques Used

- Natural Language Processing (NLP)
  - Text cleaning
  - Tokenization
  - Stopword removal
  - TF-IDF Vectorization
- Machine Learning Models
  - Logistic Regression
  - Multinomial Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

## 🛠️ Libraries

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `sklearn`
- `nltk`

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- Accuracy
- Precision
- Recall
- F1 Score
- Confusion Matrix

## 🧪 Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run all cells.
3. Install required packages with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
